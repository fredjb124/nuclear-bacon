using dir structure as below;
C:\data\java\pack_a

In java dir above there is Chap_1 class that refers to an object (Pack_a) in dir pack_a;
The Chap_1 class needs to have the below as far as an import notation goes;
import pack_a.*; and can then refer to the variable as below
System.out.println("In Chap_1_class...pack_a = "+Pack_a.pack_a_str);

The Pack_a class must have the below in the file
package pack_a; in order to be referred to in the above manner;

So when you run Chap_1 from data\java 
Chap_1 will work fine; If you want to run Pack_a from data\java
you will need to enter java pack_a/Pack_a (note the "wrong" slash for windows);

If you want to run Pack_a from data\java\pack_a run
java pack_a/Pack_a

Indeed you can run the above from anywhere as long as you can find java in the PATH var;
Try it from data\java\pack_a\pack_b;

Could run from Apple.cmd as below;
@ECHO OFF
java food/fruit/apple/Apple
or
java C:data.java.food.fruit.apple.Apple
